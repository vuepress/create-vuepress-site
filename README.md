# create-vuepress-site

Scaffolding a VuePress project

## Getting Started

### Run generator

In the desired folder, run the following command to start the VuePress site generator:

```shell
npx create-vuepress-site
# yarn create vuepress-site
```

Answer some project's information and choose one of the template:
- docs (the vuepress standard template)
- documentation-system (an opinionated documentation system based upon Divio's documentation-system)


This will create a scaffolded documentation site in the `docs` directory that is enclosed from the rest of the folder.

### Setup local environment

```shell
# Navigate into newly scaffolded docs directory
cd docs

# Install dependencies
npm install
# yarn install

# Start local dev server
npm run dev
```

By default, you should now see your scaffolded VuePress docs site at https://localhost:8080!

## Hat Tip

`create-vuepress-site` exists due to the previous work of:

- [create-vuepress](https://github.com/vuepressjs/create-vuepress)

- [create-umi](https://github.com/umijs/create-umi) (Direct reuse of scaffolding functions of the library.)
